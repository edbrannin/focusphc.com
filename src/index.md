{% card "Our History" %}
**Focus** was started in 2005, offering free pregnancy tests and support for Moms to choose life for their babies.

Over the years it has grown into a busy and well-received resource for the city of Rochester community.

We currently offer free pregnancy testing, early ultrasound referral and material aid for families who choose life for their babies.
